Who is this guy?
----------------

I am a computer engineer and information security master student in NISLAB, Norway. In 2013, I graduated from my bachelor of computer engineering in Isik University, Turkey, and immediately made the transition to full-time master degree study in NISLAB(Norwegian Information Security lab), Gjovik University. I am trying to specialize in software security trends and malware technologies. I am now working on my thesis and it is about malware obfuscation techniques for tightly coupled parallel systems.

I occasionally ride bike here, but it is hard to dedicate time nowadays. I am a sailor and waiting for the right wind and sun combination. Besides, I am trying to catch frames with my Nikon, but not professionally. (Yeah, actually I sold two frames, so far. :))

So far I have visited many countries(23), and I guess nobody can stop me to visit more.

That's all.
